salve-dom is a library able to validate XML documents stored in DOM trees
according to a Relax NG schema. It uses
[salve](https://github.com/mangalam-research/salve) to perform the validation
and has the same general limitations. This library was extracted from the
[wed](https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed) XML editor. The algorithms used
here have been in production for years.

Note that the validation facilities provided by this library are geared towards
validating a document while it is being edited. The API provides functions that
are meaningful in that kind of context. However, there's nothing that prevents
using this library to perform a "batch" validation of the kind you'd do by
running a validator at the command line (for instance).

Using
=====

The library is written in TypeScript but can be used by JavaScript code. The wed
editor mentioned above was still implemented in ES5 when it started using
`salve-dom`, though it has since been converted to TypeScript.

However, if you are using JavaScript you still need to pay attention to the
TypeScript annotations and pay *special* attention to:

1. What is public and what is not public in the API. Anything that the
   TypeScript type annotations do not expose to TypeScript code is private.
   **Relying on private parts of the code is an API violation.**

2. What is marked ``readonly``. **Writing a variable marked ``readonly`` is an
   API violation.**

3. Objects marked readonly by their name. For instance, TypeScript has a
   ``ReadonlyArray`` generic which can be used to mark an array as being
   immutable. The thing is though that the underlying JavaScript array is still
   mutable. **Mutating objects that are meant to be immutable is an API
   violation.**

The nitty-gritty details are in the ``typedoc`` comments that addorn the source
code. You should rely on these. Note that ``typedoc`` is still at an early stage
of development compared to tools like JSDoc. Some of the documentation tags are
not recognized by ``typedoc`` but are nonetheless used to record useful
information.

The big picture:

* You create a ``Validator`` object that will validate a DOM tree according to
  your Relax NG schema. Let's say your new validator is ``validator``.

* You install event listeners to listen for events on ``validator.events``.

* You start it with ``validator.start()``.

* You can stop it before it is done with ``validator.stop()``.

* The current state of validation is available with
  ``validator.getWorkingState()`` and ``validator.errors``.

* Editors that do validation during editing will want to use methods like
  ``possibleAt, possibleWhere, speculativelyValidate, etc.``

* The ``Validator`` class calls a method named ``_runDocumentValidation`` when
  it is done with a document. The default implementation of
  ``_runDocumentValidation`` is a no-op. A class extending ``Validator`` could
  override this protected method to perform validation that cannot be modeled in
  Relax NG. The implementation may call the protected method ``_processError``
  to add errors to the validation results.

Caveats
=======

1. The schema must have been processed with salve in order to be used by the
   ``Validator`` class. In versions of salve prior to 6.0.0 you used the CLI
   tool ``salve-convert`` for this. From 6.0.0 onwards ``salve-convert`` is
   deprecated and you should instead use salve's conversion API.

2. Errors report the DOM ``Node`` where the errors occur. This works fine if you
   are showing the actual document being validated to the user: you can just
   highlight the erroring node. (This is what
   [wed](https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed) does.)

   In a "batch" mode of operation, however, where we typically want to report
   errors with reference to line/column numbers, there is a problem because DOM
   nodes do not record line and column information. The issue here is largely a
   consequence of validating DOM trees. You *could* fairly easily compute a
   location from the erroring node and the serialization of the DOM tree (from
   ``outerHTML``). However, the serialization of the DOM tree is not necessarily
   the same sequence of bytes as the string that was originally parsed into a
   tree. So this may not be particularly useful.

   Trying to match the erroring node to the *source* in a robust way (i.e. which
   would work with any XML thrown at it) would probably be as complicated as
   writing an XML parser. If you *must* report errors with line and column
   numbers that refer to the source as provided by the user, your best bet is to
   use salve in conjuction with a library like
   [sax](https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js). Salve's own source code and test
   suite have examples of such usage.

Browser Requirements
====================

You should check the requirements provided in salve's own README if you want
details regarding what the JavaScript environment must support. The short story
is that we recommend using [``core-js``](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) on
browsers that are too old.

Additionally, your browser must have support for ``firstElementChild`` and its
associated properties on nodes that implement the ``Document``, ``Element`` and
``CharacterData`` interfaces. **If your target browser does not have this, then
you need a polyfill that provides it.** Chrome and Firefox have not needed such
polyfill for a long time but IE and Edge need it. (A polyfill is included in the
``polyfills`` subdirectory.)

salve-dom passes its test suite on:

* Chrome, Firefox, IE 11, Edge, Opera and Safari form Mavericks onwards. It has
  been tested on "relatively recent versions".

Performance Note on FF
======================

The performance on FF 52 is **bad**. Most of the browsers mentioned above are in
the same ballpark performance-wise. However, when the test suite is run on FF
52, it takes easily 3 to 4 times as long as on other browsers. There seem to be
a noticable performance degradation bump at FF 49, getting progressively worse
with newer versions.

We unfortunately do not have time to track down what could be causing this
performance drop on FF.

Loading
=======

Two general options:

1. Load it as a UMD module. You must configure your loader to load the
   ``salve-dom*.js`` bundles in the root of the installed ``salve-dom``
   package. This probably your best bet if you want to use the library
   "as-is". The ``salve`` module is required by these bundles, so it must be
   available through whatever module loader you use.

2. Load it as a collection of modules. You'll find the modules in the ``lib``
   subdirectory of the installed package. These modules are in the CommonJS
   format. This allows creating custom bundles (e.g. combine salve-dom and salve
   in a single bundle).
